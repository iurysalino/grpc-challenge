Challenge 3

Starts on = Tuesday February 15th 00 : 00 : 00 . 000 Tip: Read all steps first! Plan your implementation already knowing
the next steps (we donâ€™t have this privilege in real life)
Choose well your abstractions, plan what your classes will be.

Step 1 Create a gRPC client and server on Java able to create and view products stored in a database of your choice (may
be MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, anything). The client should be able to create a few products, providing its ID, name,
stock and price. Create unit tests for both server and client. Deadline: Thursday February 17th 23 : 59 : 59 . 99 9 Step

Add methods on your server to create a shopping cart, add products to the shopping cart and finish the sale, returning
the total value of this shopping cart. Deadline: Monday February 21th 23 : 59 : 59 . 99 9 Step 3

Add a method gRPC that imports/exports all products from/to Parquet, Orc or JSON. Deadline: Friday February 25th 23 :
59 : 59 . 99 9 Step 4

Add support to export/import data in another format, should be able to switch between formats depending on the request
parameters. Deadline: Tuesday March 1st 23 : 59 : 59 . 99 9 Step 5

Create a REST API for your project, should be able to switch between gRPC and the REST API, you can use Sprint or any
